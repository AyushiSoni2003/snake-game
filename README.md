# Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake game created using Python and the `turtle` module. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat food that appears on the screen, which causes the snake to grow in length and increase the score. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or its own body.

## Game Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake with the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`).
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the boundary or its own body.
